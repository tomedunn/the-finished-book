Welcome! These posts are a collection of my thoughts and analysis on D&D 5th edition. It's possible I will expand this to other games or topics in the future, but for now my focus will be exclusively on D&D.

This is not a blog, and I will not be sticking to any kind of regular posting schedule. I like to do these sorts of analysis in my spare time. When I find something worth sharing I'll post about it.
