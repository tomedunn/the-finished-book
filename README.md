# [The Finished Book](https://tomedunn.github.io/the-finished-book/)

The Finished Book is a collection of my thoughts and analysis on Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition. Itâ€™s possible I will expand this to other games or topics in the future, but for now my focus will be exclusively on D&D.

## Software

The Finished Book is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and is built on top of the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll theme.

The mathematical equations shown throughout the site are produced using the [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) JavaScript library, and the figures and analysis are produced using [Python](https://www.python.org/) in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

### Python libraries

The following Python libraries are used for analysis throughout the site:

 * [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
 * [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
 * [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
 * [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
 * [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
